This module is an improvement of base HTML file input. As HTML file input, you can choose to enable or disable multiple file selection, but this module also allows you to list the selected files separately and to delete them one by one. Moreover, it can be used with the [S3 upload module](https://fast-modular-project.com/modules/upload-to-S3-bucket) to process the files directly.
